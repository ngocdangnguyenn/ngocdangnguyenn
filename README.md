## Welcome
I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Aix-Marseille University, passionate about transforming data into insights and building intelligent solutions. Data Science and AI are my playground—where curiosity meets code.
### What drives me
I'm motivated by the challenge of solving real-world problems through data and machine learning. I learn best by doing—building projects, experimenting with new tools, and pushing my technical boundaries. Every dataset tells a story, and I'm here to uncover it.
Trilingual in English, French, and Vietnamese, I thrive in collaborative, multicultural environments where clear communication and adaptability matter.
### Tech Stack
- Languages & Core: Python, Java, C, SQL
- Data & ML: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- Tools: Jupyter, Git
### What's next?
I'm actively seeking a Data or AI internship starting in April 2026 to apply my skills, gain hands-on industry experience, and prepare for a Master's in Artificial Intelligence.
